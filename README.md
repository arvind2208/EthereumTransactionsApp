# Getting Started with Transaction Search UI
This is a basic app to display the search results by calling transaction search endpoint. Enter the block number and address to search for transactions. 
For simplicity, the url (port 5000) is hard coded. Please start the backend server before running the app.

The app only uses basic css. I've not used styling components
